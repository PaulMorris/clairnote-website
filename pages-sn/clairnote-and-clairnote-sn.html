Clairnote SN is a different "flavor" or variant of Clairnote music notation. The SN stands for "standard noteheads".  There are a few key differences between them.  A picture is worth a thousand words.

As you can see in the image above, Clairnote uses hollow and solid noteheads for pitch, while Clairnote SN does not.  Clairnote gives half notes double stems to differentiate them from quarter notes. Clairnote SN fully adopts standard music notation's rhythm notation system, using solid noteheads for quarter notes (and shorter), and hollow noteheads for half notes (and longer).

Where Clairnote has a highly visible 6-6 pattern of alternating solid and hollow noteheads, Clairnote SN has a more subtle 6-6 pattern of alternating line notes and space notes.  Clairnote SN uses ledger lines (for the notes D, F-sharp/G-flat, and A-sharp/B-flat) to provide this regularly alternating pattern.

In short, Clairnote SN has more in common with standard music notation.  That makes it somewhat easier to learn both the standard system and Clairnote SN at thesame time and to use them interchangeably. On the other hand, Clairnote's use of solid and hollow noteheads makes the differences between notes (and intervals) more visually prominent.

Some people may prefer Clairnote, and others may prefer Clairnote SN. Both offer similar advantages over standard music notation.

Most pages on this site have both Clairnote and a Clairnote SN versions.  (This does not include the blog part of the site.)  You can think of the site as two parallel sites, one for each system.  While browsing you can switch between these two sites/systems via the links in the "More" menu.clairnote
