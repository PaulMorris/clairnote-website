In Clairnote SN intervals are easy to identify since each interval is visually distinct and it is simple to distinguish one interval from another. The <a title="6-6 Pitch Pattern" href="http://clairnote.org/sn/6-6-pitch-pattern/">6-6 pitch pattern</a> in the line pattern contributes to this. If an interval spans an even number of semitones then both notes are line notes, or both are space notes. If it spans an odd number of semitones one note is a line note and the other is a space note.

For example, you can see the difference between major thirds and minor thirds (shown above), which is not possible in traditional music notation. When compared with <a href="http://musicnotation.org/tutorials/intervals1.html" target="_blank" rel="external">intervals in traditional music notation</a>, Clairnote SN is more clear, consistent, and direct.

Intervals are some of the most basic building blocks of music. Being able to clearly and consistently see the differences between them leads to a better awareness and understanding of music and common musical patterns.

Improvising and playing by ear are skills that are largely done through interval relationships between notes. Yet in traditional notation these relationships between notes are obscured. How might one's ability to play by ear and improvise improve through using a better music notation system?

Below is a comprehensive illustration of all the common intervals (from unisons up through octaves) showing the consistent pattern in their appearance. The number of semitones spanned by each interval is given in parentheses.

The following two PDF files contain illustrations of intervals in Clairnote SN like those shown below, but arranged in a 4Ã—3 grid pattern in order to highlight similarities in their appearance.
