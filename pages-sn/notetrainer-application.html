Learn to read Clairnote SN music notation with this simple "NoteTrainer" application.  You read the (random) series of notes it displays and play them on a MIDI keyboard.  As you play it lets you know if you have played the correct note or not.  Here's what it looks like:

You can customize how many octaves the staff spans and which set of notes you want to work on reading.  There is also an option to show solfege note names next to each note on the staff.  The application requires a MIDI keyboard or other MIDI instrument or device.

<strong>Download the application from <a href="https://github.com/zmeyc/notetrainer/releases" target="_blank">this page on Github</a></strong>

Precompiled binaries are available for Windows (.exe) and Mac (.dmg) or download and build the source code for GNU/Linux.
