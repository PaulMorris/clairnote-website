Clairnote uses the same rhythm notation symbols as traditional notation, except:
<ul>
 	<li>Hollow and solid notes are used to help indicate pitch instead of duration.</li>
 	<li>Half notes have a double stem to distinguish them from quarter notes.</li>
</ul>
Here is a comparison showing notes of different durations:

And a comparison focusing on half notes and quarter notes:

Dotted notes, tied notes, rests, slurs, and other articulations are the same in Clairnote as they are in traditional notation.  Here is another comparison showing rests of different durations.

<h2>Distinguishing Half Notes and Quarter Notes</h2>
Using double stems for half notes distinguishes them from quarter notes, and symbolizes how their duration is twice as long.  It also has the benefit of consolidating duration symbols into variations on the stem.  The rest of the duration and rhythm symbols are the same as in traditional notation, making it easier to read both Clairnote and traditional notation "bilingually."  Since quarter notes generally occur more frequently than half notes it makes sense for them to look the same as in traditional notation, with a single stem and no flag.
<h2>Why Use Hollow and Solid Notes to Indicate Pitch?</h2>
In traditional notation hollow and solid notes are used simply to differentiate between half notes and quarter notes. (Other note durations are distinguished through other symbols like flags or lack of stem as shown above.) But consider that the one thing that is most visually apparent about a note is whether it is solid or hollow. At a glance it is much easier to see that a note is solid or hollow than to determine its position on the staff.

Isn't it a poor use of this prominent visual feature to use it simply to differentiate between half notes and quarter notes? Wouldn't it be better to use hollow and solid notes to make it easier to identify a note's pitch? And also to provide the benefits of the <a title="6-6 Pitch Pattern" href="http://clairnote.org/6-6-pitch-pattern/">6-6 pitch pattern</a>? This is Clairnote 's approach.

Using hollow and solid noteheads to help indicate pitch makes it easier to quickly identify notes and tell them apart.  It also provides the benefits of the <a title="6-6 Pitch Pattern" href="http://clairnote.org/6-6-pitch-pattern/">6-6 pitch pattern</a>, namely making interval relationships clearer and easier to distinguish from one another. This is illustrated on the <a title="Scales" href="http://clairnote.org/scales/">Scales</a> and <a title="Intervals" href="http://clairnote.org/intervals/">Intervals</a> pages.

<h2>Why Not Try to Improve Upon Traditional Rhythm Notation?</h2>
It would probably be possible to come up with a novel rhythm notation system that was more consistent or systematic. This has not been a priority with Clairnote, mainly because it would increase the learning curve for those who already know traditional notation or who want to learn it alongside Clairnote. Using the traditional rhythm notation (with one small change that brings big benefits) provides greater continuity with traditional notation and makes it easier for musicians to learn to read both systems interchangeably.

That said, anyone who wants to further innovate and use Clairnote with an alternative rhythm notation system is welcome to do so (provided they communicate that it is not Clairnote 's standard rhythm notation).
