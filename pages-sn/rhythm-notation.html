Clairnote SN uses the same rhythm notation symbols as traditional notation.  Here are some comparisons showing notes of different durations:

Dotted notes, tied notes, rests, slurs, and other articulations are the same in Clairnote SN as they are in traditional notation.  Here is another comparison showing rests of different durations.

<h2>Why Not Try to Improve Upon Traditional Rhythm Notation?</h2>
It would probably be possible to come up with a novel rhythm notation system that was more consistent or systematic. This has not been a priority with Clairnote SN, mainly because it would increase the learning curve for those who already know traditional notation or who want to learn it alongside Clairnote SN. Using the traditional rhythm notation system provides greater continuity with traditional notation and makes it easier for musicians to learn to read both systems interchangeably.

That said, anyone who wants to further innovate and use Clairnote SN with an alternative rhythm notation system is welcome to do so (provided they communicate that it is not Clairnote SN's standard rhythm notation).
