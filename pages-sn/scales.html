Clairnote SN makes it easy to see the interval patterns that make up scales. Each type of scale has a consistent visible pattern. For example, the C major scale begins with <em>three</em> solid notes, followed by <em>four</em> hollow notes. Each major scale has this same "3-solid, 4-hollow" pattern (or vice-versa: 3-hollow, 4-solid). It reflects the pattern of whole step and half step intervals that make up the major scale (W-W-H-W-W-W-H).

Minor scales also have their own particular visual pattern. As shown above, each natural minor scale has a "2-solid, 3-hollow, 2-solid" pattern (or vice-versa). This reflects its particular combination of whole steps and half steps (W-H-W-W-H-W-W).

This works because half steps are always a solid note and a hollow note, while whole steps are always two solid notes or two hollow notes. In traditional notation there is no visual distinction between whole steps and half steps, which makes it difficult to see and understand the interval patterns of scales. The clear and consistent visual appearance of intervals in Clairnote SN makes this much easier.

You can easily see these visual patterns in the scales shown below. "W" indicates a whole step and "H" indicates a half step.

<h2>More Scales</h2>
So far we have only considered the major and <em>natural</em> minor scales that contain the notes found in major and minor keys. Other types of scales such as <a href="http://cnx.org/content/m10856/latest/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">melodic minor, harmonic minor,</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentatonic_scale" target="_blank">pentatonic</a> each have their own distinct interval pattern that corresponds to an easily visible pattern of hollow and solid notes in Clairnote SN, as you can see in the images below.

As you can see Clairnote SN represents intervals like whole steps, half steps, and minor thirds clearly and consistently. That makes it easy to see and understand the basic interval patterns that make up scales â€” common patterns that are found in a broad range of music.
